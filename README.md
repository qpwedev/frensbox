<p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Revolutionizing networking with decentralization and human connection</p>

> **Note** 
> Project is built with the intention of creating more meaningful connections through an innovative approach to networking

## Description
In the age where networking at conferences can feel impersonal and ineffective, FrensBox seeks to bring the human connection back into the equation. We took inspiration from the friend journals of our childhood and created a decentralized version of it.

FrensBox is a client for a decentralized, on-chain protocol (CRM). It's client-agnostic, which means anyone can build any client for the social graph.

The main problem FrensBox is trying to solve is to bring more context into networking. It aims to facilitate more meaningful peer-to-peer connections that can continue beyond the initial interaction.

## Technologies
FrensBox is built using Typescript, NextJS and Lens API.

## Setup
To run FrensBox, you need to build it using npm and then start it:

1. Build the project
```bash
npm build 
```

2. Start the project
```
npm start 
```
This will start FrensBox and you can begin using the protocol. Further instructions on usage will be provided as the project continues to evolve.

Stay tuned for more updates and features!
